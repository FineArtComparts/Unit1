# Unit1
***Year 1 Unit 1: Introduction to Fine Art and Computational Arts (Human Computation)***
This unit explores the blurred boundary between human activity and computation. Before the invention of electronic machines, a "computer" was a job title, not a device. During this unit, we'll return to the core principles of computation, tapping into the power of algorithmic thinking to generate new meanings through the development of systems, process-driven explorations and collaborative methods.

By examining how patterns in nature or ancestral crafts have inspired contemporary computation, this unit investigates how process-based practices offers new perspectives on encoded knowledge.You will be introduced to different strategies in art, image-making, music, and poetry, in which artists design and carry out instructions and chance operations to generate outputs. From rolling dice, weaving, to writing out instructions for others, process-led art has inspired recent explorations in computational arts.

You will develop a research file containing references, ideas, and experiments related to these themes. Documentation of experimental work developed during the unit should include tests, processes, documentation, material investigations, sketches and works in progress. All material must be annotated, and you must reflect on why you have selected different methods and materials and how they connect with your ideas. These can be notes about subject matter, process, materials or concepts; anything to show how research has been conducted. In addition, you are expected to include notes about the unit lectures and events. This should include other artists, exhibitions, as well as other areas of research and/or reading.
